# Console-Space-Shooter
Class: Object Oriented Programming

Author: Jose Rivera

This project was my first game to use pointers and different data structures such as lists and vectors. 
We were tasked to use the template the instructor gave us to create a space shooter game of our choosing.
I went for "Space Invaders" style of game except this was a one on one fight between you and the enemy ship.

I used a combination of console drawing and audio to make a playable game.
